About CUTE
==========
Quote from cute-test.com: CUTE is an easy to use C++ unit testing framework that
leverages modern C++ libraries and features. CUTE is orthogonal, easily 
extendable and much simpler than other C++ unit testing approaches like CPPUnit.
For example, CUTE does not require that you write a derived class for each C++
class you want to unit test.
